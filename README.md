# MERN: Book Search Engine

## Description

Using starter code with a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, I refactored it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.
